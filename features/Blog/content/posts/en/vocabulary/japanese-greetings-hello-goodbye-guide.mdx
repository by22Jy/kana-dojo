| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |

| ありがとうございます | arigatou gozaimasu | Thank you         | Gratitude (polite) |
| すみません           | sumimasen          | Excuse me / Sorry | Getting attention  |
| おねがいします       | onegai shimasu     | Please            | Requests           |
| はじめまして         | hajimemashite      | Nice to meet you  | First meetings     |
| おやすみなさい       | oyasumi nasai      | Good night        | Bedtime            |
| いってきます         | ittekimasu         | I'm leaving       | Leaving home       |

## Saying Hello: Time-Based Greetings

Japanese greetings change throughout the day:

### おはようございます (Ohayou gozaimasu) – Good Morning

**When:** From waking until around 10-11am

**Formality levels:**
| Version | Romaji | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| おはようございます | ohayou gozaimasu | Polite (strangers, work, elders) |
| おはよう | ohayou | Casual (friends, family) |

**Cultural note:** Even at casual workplaces, the first greeting to colleagues is typically the polite form. After the first meeting of the day, casual forms are fine.

**Pronunciation tip:** oh-ha-YO-u go-za-i-MAS (not "ohio")

### こんにちは (Konnichiwa) – Hello / Good Afternoon

**When:** From late morning (~10-11am) until early evening (~5-6pm)

**Note:** This is the most "neutral" Japanese greeting, similar to English "hello."

**Fun fact:** 今日は (konnichiwa) literally comes from 今日は... (as for today...), which was part of longer greetings that got shortened over centuries!

**Common mistake:** こんにちは is NOT used with family or close friends at home. It's for acquaintances, strangers, and semi-formal situations.

### こんばんは (Konbanwa) – Good Evening

**When:** From early evening (~5-6pm) onwards

**Pronunciation:** kon-BAN-wa

**Usage:** Similar to こんにちは – used with acquaintances and in polite situations.

<InfoBox type='tip'>
  When in doubt about morning vs. afternoon, こんにちは is safe! It's the most
  versatile greeting.
</InfoBox>

## Casual Greetings (Friends & Family)

These are for informal situations with close relationships:

### よ！/ よー！(Yo!) – Hey!

Super casual, mostly used by young people, typically male. Like "Hey!" or "Yo!" in English.

### おす！(Osu!) – Hey! / Sup!

Very casual, masculine. Common in martial arts contexts and among young men.

### やあ (Yaa) – Hi

Soft, casual greeting. Less gendered than おす.

### ういっす (Uissu) – Hey / What's up

Very casual, slangy. Derived from ういっすお疲れ様 (お疲れ様 greeting).

### どうも (Doumo) – Hey / Thanks / Sorry

Multi-purpose casual word:

- As greeting: "Hey" (very casual)
- As thanks: "Thanks" (casual ありがとう)
- As apology: "Sorry" (casual すみません)

### ひさしぶり (Hisashiburi) – Long time no see!

When you haven't seen someone in a while:

| Version        | Romaji            | Formality |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| お久しぶりです | ohisashiburi desu | Polite    |
| 久しぶり！     | hisashiburi!      | Casual    |

## Saying Goodbye

Japanese has many ways to part, depending on context:

### さようなら (Sayounara) – Goodbye

**When:** Formal farewell; used when you won't see someone for a while

**Warning:** Despite being the "textbook" goodbye, さようなら can feel heavy or final. It's NOT the common casual goodbye!

### じゃあね (Jaa ne) – See ya!

Casual, friendly. The go-to goodbye for friends.

**Variations:**

- じゃあ (jaa) – shortest, very casual
- じゃあね (jaa ne) – friendly
- じゃあまたね (jaa mata ne) – see you again

### またね (Mata ne) – See you again

Casual, implies you'll meet again. Can combine with じゃあ.

### また明日 (Mata ashita) – See you tomorrow

When you'll definitely meet the next day (school, work).

### バイバイ (Baibai) – Bye-bye

Borrowed from English, used casually, often by/with young people or children. Cute and informal.

### 失礼します (Shitsurei shimasu) – Excuse me (I'm leaving)

Formal/polite way to excuse yourself:

- Leaving a room
- Hanging up the phone
- Leaving work before others

**Post-work variation:** お先に失礼します (osaki ni shitsurei shimasu) – "Excuse me for leaving first" (when leaving work before colleagues)

### お疲れ様です (Otsukaresama desu) – Great work / See you (work)

The Swiss Army knife of Japanese work culture:

- Greeting when passing colleagues
- "Hello" when answering work calls
- "Goodbye" when leaving work
- Acknowledging someone's hard work

**Casual version:** お疲れ！(otsukare!) – "Good job!"

<InfoBox type='note'>
  At Japanese workplaces, you'll hear お疲れ様 constantly! It's less "goodbye"
  and more "thanks for your effort."
</InfoBox>

## Coming and Going (Home Phrases)

Japanese has specific greetings for leaving and returning home:

### いってきます (Ittekimasu) – I'm leaving

**Who says it:** Person leaving

**Meaning:** "I'm going and coming back"

Said when leaving home for work, school, errands, etc.

### いってらっしゃい (Itterasshai) – Take care / See you later

**Who says it:** Person staying home

**Meaning:** "Go and come back safely"

The response to いってきます.

### ただいま (Tadaima) – I'm home

### おかえり (Okaeri) – Welcome back

**Who says it:** Person already at home

**Meaning:** "You've returned"

Response to ただいま.

**Polite version:** おかえりなさい (okaerinasai)

**Example Exchange:**

> Person leaving: いってきます！
> Family at home: いってらっしゃい！
> (Later...)
> Person returning: ただいま！
> Family at home: おかえり！

## Thank You and You're Welcome

### ありがとう (Arigatou) – Thank you

**Formality levels:**

| Japanese                   | Romaji                       | Level           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| どうも                     | doumo                        | Very casual     |
| ありがとう                 | arigatou                     | Casual          |
| ありがとうございます       | arigatou gozaimasu           | Polite          |
| どうもありがとうございます | doumo arigatou gozaimasu     | Very polite     |
| 誠にありがとうございます   | makoto ni arigatou gozaimasu | Formal/business |

**When to use polite forms:**

### どういたしまして (Dou itashimashite) – You're welcome

The textbook response, but often sounds overly formal in casual situations.

**More common responses:**

| いえいえ | ieie | Not at all | Humble deflection |
| 大丈夫 | daijoubu | It's okay | Casual |
| とんでもない | tondemonai | Don't mention it | Polite deflection |

<InfoBox type='tip'>

  いえいえ (ieie - "no, no") is very common!
</InfoBox>

## Apologies and Excuse Me

### すみません (Sumimasen) – Excuse me / Sorry

The ultimate multi-purpose phrase:

**Uses:**

1. Getting attention: "Excuse me!" (calling a waiter)
2. Light apology: "Sorry" (bumping into someone)
3. Thanking: Implies "Sorry to trouble you" + gratitude
4. Passing by: "Excuse me" (moving through a crowd)

### ごめんなさい (Gomen nasai) – I'm sorry

- "Nice to meet you" (after introduction)
- "Please treat me well"
- "I look forward to working with you"

**Common pattern:**

1. はじめまして (Nice to meet you)

3. よろしくおねがいします (Please treat me well)

**Example:**

> はじめまして。田中です。よろしくおねがいします。
> "Nice to meet you. I'm Tanaka. Pleased to meet you."

## Phone Greetings

### もしもし (Moshi moshi) – Hello? (Phone)

Used ONLY on the phone, typically when answering or checking if the other person is still there.

**Note:** Don't use もしもし for in-person greetings – it's phone-specific!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are there so many ways to say the same thing?

Japanese has many politeness levels. The same meaning can be expressed casually or formally depending on:

- Your relationship with the person
- The setting (work vs. home)
- Age differences
- Social hierarchy

### Which forms should I learn first?

**Start with polite forms (ございます, ます):**

- Safe in any situation
- Expected from foreigners
- Never offensive

Learn casual forms after you understand when to use them.

### Is さようなら really rude?

Not rude, but can feel final or dramatic. It's like saying "farewell" in English instead of "bye." Use じゃあね or またね for casual goodbyes.

### Do I need to bow?

Foreigners aren't expected to bow perfectly, but a slight bow with greetings shows respect and is always appreciated!

## Conclusion: Start Using Greetings Today!

Greetings are your first step into Japanese communication. Master these, and you'll make positive impressions everywhere you go.

**Key takeaways:**
✅ Learn time-based greetings (おはよう・こんにちは・こんばんは)
