## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is 4:00 "yo-ji" not "shi-ji"?

The reading し (shi) sounds like 死 (death), so it's avoided. 四 can be read よん (yon) or し (shi), but for time, よ (yo) is used.

### How do I say "at" a specific time?

Add に after the time:

- 三時**に**会いましょう = Let's meet **at** 3 o'clock

### What's the difference between 時 and 時間?

- 時 (ji) = o'clock (point in time)
- 時間 (jikan) = hours/duration
